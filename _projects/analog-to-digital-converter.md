## Overview

As the final project for ENPH 259, I constructed a fully functional **Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC)** using fundamental electronic components. This ADC translates analog signals into digital values and displays the result on a 7-segment display, with each unit representing 0.1 volts.

The overall project consists of the following subcomponents:
- **Trigger Pulse Generator**: Clears the counter and starts the time measurement.
- **Clock Pulse Generator**: Produces a square wave for timekeeping.
- **Counter**: Counts the clock pulses during the time window generated by the analog voltage.
- **Analog-to-Time Converter (ATC)**: Converts analog voltage into a proportional time interval.
- **Control Logic**: Coordinates the ADC operations by controlling counting and reset signals.

### Key Highlights:
- Calibrated the ADC to ensure accurate voltage-to-digital conversion within a functional range of 0-5V.
- Debugged and resolved critical issues like improper waveforms, incorrect counting, and voltage calibration errors.
- Developed a timing diagram to verify and visualize the ADC's operation.
